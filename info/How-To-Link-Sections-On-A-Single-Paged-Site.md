# QUICK NOTE ! 

## How do you link a navigation bar to a section on the same page?

### The simplest way is to just give the href #id_name in your navigation bar â€œa" tag link, 
### and then give this href hash name to the content section id attribute where should be navigate to.
### Then this will navigate to section where you have added this name as a id in the page. 

### E.g 

### <a href="#id_name"> about </a>  

### <div id="id_name"> </div> 


### See <a href = "index.html"> </a> for more on usage
